[Verse 1]
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Outro]
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial

[Verse 1]
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say he's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Verse 2]
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

Who likes all our pretty songs

And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[Pre-Chorus]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[Verse 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

[Chorus]
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said
She said, she said

[Outro]
Said... good

[Verse 1]
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 3]
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself


[Intro]
Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

[Verse 1]
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

[Verse 2]
Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

[Verse 3]
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

[Chorus]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

[Outro]
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there!
Gotta find a way! Aah! Aah!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Bridge]
You, you, you
You, you, you

[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you


[Chorus 1]
Monkey see, monkey do (I don't know why)
Rather be dead than cool (I don't know why)
Every line ends in rhyme (I don't know why)
Less is more, love is blind (I don't know why)

[Chorus 2]
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away

[Verse]
Give an inch, take a smile (I don't know why)
Fashion shits, fashion style (I don't know why)
Blow it out, keep it in (I don't know why)
Have to have poison skin (I don't know why)

[Chorus 2]
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away

[Bridge]
(I don't know why)
(I don't know why)

[Chorus 2]
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away

[Chorus 1]
Monkey see, monkey do (I don't know why)
Rather be dead than cool (I don't know why)
Every line ends in rhyme (I don't know why)
Less is more, love is blind (I don't know why)

[Chorus 2]
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away

[Bridge]
(I don't know why)
(I don't know why)

[Chorus 2]
Stay, stay away
Stay away
Stay away

[Outro]
Yeah!
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
God is gay

[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 2]
My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Bridge]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse]
Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from my ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

[Chorus]
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

[Verse]
Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak

And the drippings from my ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

[Chorus]
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

[Verse 1]
Silence
Here I am
Here I am
Silent
Bright and clear
It's what I am
I have
Died

[Interlude]
Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother

[Verse 2]
Death
And violence
Excitement
Right here
Died
Go to hell
Here I am
Right here
Ow!

[Interlude]
Mother, no mas
No mas, mama

[Verse 3]
Death
Is what I am
Go to hell
Go to jail
In back of that
Crime
Here I am
Take a chance
Dead

Die
